A cannon fight game created as final project to Introduction to Game Development at Universidade Federal do ABC - 2Q2015
This game was inspirated by a old game called [Bang! Bang!](http://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Bang!_Bang!.html) made for windows.

##How to play
``w,a,s,d and the arrows`` - I'll not insult your inteligence

``space`` - Fire (hold it to charge)

It's a turn based game for two players, like in the old days.
The cannons do not "walk", you can only change it's pitch and yaw

Wins who shoot the other player first (I bet you didn't know)
